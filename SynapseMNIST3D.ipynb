              "    Description: The SynapseMNIST3D is a new 3D volume dataset to classify whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory. It uses a 3D image volume of an adult rat acquired by a multi-beam scanning electron microscope. The original data is of the size 100×100×100um^3 and the resolution 8×8×30nm^3, where a (30um)^3 sub-volume was used in the MitoEM dataset with dense 3D mitochondria instance segmentation labels. Three neuroscience experts segment a pyramidal neuron within the whole volume and proofread all the synapses on this neuron with excitatory/inhibitory labels. For each labeled synaptic location, we crop a 3D volume of 1024×1024×1024nm^3 and resize it into 28×28×28 voxels. Finally, the dataset is randomly split with a ratio of 7:1:2 into training, validation and test set.\n",
